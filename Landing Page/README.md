I am currently practicing my HTML and CSS skills by creating a landing page for my brothers business. It has everything I've learned so far and I am continually updating it as I learn more interesting techniques.

Javascript is the next thing I am working and I will be updating this website in the future. 

Any suggestions or ways I can improve the webpage is greatly appreciated!
